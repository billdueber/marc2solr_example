    # Custom routines are defined as module methods that take two arguments: a MARC4J4R record,
    # and an (optional) array of other arguments passed in. 
    #
    # They don't need to live in the MARC2Solr::Custom namespace, but it's not a bad idea to use, e.g.,
    # MARC2Solr::Custom::UMich, or maybe MARC2Solr::Custom::DateStuff
    #
    # You can return multiple values in an array
    
    # The simplest possible example; just call a method on the underlying MARC4J4R record
    # Note that even though we don't use the arguments, the method signature has to 
    # support it

    # are times when you several fields are based on intermediate values that you
    # don't want to actually store in the solr document itself (e.g., a set of call number
    # that you want to normalize or translate in a few different ways, without actually wanting
    # to store the raw callnumbers in their own field). You may also need access to more metadata
    # as you're constructing the data (e.g., you may want to store titles and titles-without-non-filing-
    # character in different fields, but you can't compute one from the other wihout access to the
    # associated indicator-2 value). 
    #
    # So, in this case, we'll get the pubDate and the pubDateRange all at once, just as an example,
    # and put in the custom spec as:
    #
    # {
    #   :solrField => ['pubDate', 'pubDateRange'],
    #   :module => MARC2Solr::Custom,
    #   :functionSymbol => :pubDateAndRange
